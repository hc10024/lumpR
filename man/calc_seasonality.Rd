\title{Calculate time series based on seasonality}
\usage{
calc_seasonality(rainy_season, seasonality, timezone = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{rainy_season}{\code{data.frame} giving start and end dates of the rainy season.
     Output of function \code{\link[LUMP]{rainy_season}}. See doc for information on
     data structure.}

\item{seasonality}{\code{data.frame} or \code{matrix} giving id value (corresponding
     to first column of \code{rainy_season}) and the respective 4 node values of the
     target variable: First value: Start day of year (DOY) of rainy season. 2: DOY
     when climax of vegetation is reached. 3: End DOY of rainy season (begin of
     vegetation degradation). 4: End of main phase of vegetation degradation.}

\item{timezone}{Timezone the date-time values of the output object shall refer to.
     If nothing is specified your system's timezone is used.}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{\link[xts]{xts}} with daily values of the target
     variable. Columns refer to the stations specified in the first column of
     the input object \code{rainy_season}.
}
\description{
Function calculates a daily time series of a (vegetation) variable based on
information about the seasonality of that variable.
