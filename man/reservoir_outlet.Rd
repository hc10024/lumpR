\title{Determine outlet coordinates of reservoirs}
\usage{
reservoir_outlet(flowacc = NULL, dem = NULL, res_vct, outlets_vect)
}
\arguments{
\item{flowacc}{Flow accumulation raster in GRASS location used for determination
     of reservoir outlets (= highest accumulation value). Set to \code{NULL} if
     it should be calculated based on a DEM. Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{dem}{Digital elevation model in GRASS location used for calculation of
     flow accumulation if no flow accumulation raster is given. Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{res_vct}{Reservoir vector file in GRASS location. For each polygon coordinates
     of the outlet (cell with highest flow accumulation) are determined. Needs
     at least the column \code{name} as reservoir identifier.}

\item{outlets_vect}{Output: Name of vector file of outlet locations to be exported
     to GRASS location.}
}
\value{
\code{SpatialPoints} object containing outlet position for each reservoir
     polygon and vector file \code{outlets_vect} exported to GRASS location.
}
\description{
Takes a flow accumulation raster (or DEM for computation) and reservoir vector
file from a GRASS location and estimates the outlet coordinates of each reservoir
polygon.
}
\note{
Prepare GRASS location and necessary files in advance and start GRASS
     session in R using \code{\link[spgrass6]{initGRASS}}. Location should not
     contain any maps ending on *_t as these will be removed by calling the
     function to remove temporary maps.

     Check the results by investigationg vector file with outlet points written
     to GRASS location.
