Description: The package provides functions for a semi-automated approach of
    the delineation and description of landscape units and partition into terrain
    components. It can be used for the pre-processing of semi-distributed large-
    scale hydrological and erosion models using catena-representation (WASA-SED,
    CATFLOW). It is closely connected to and uses functionalities of GRASS GIS.
    Additional pre-processing tools beyond the scope of the original LUMP are
    included.
